This plugin is a working copy of the original switch-note plugin by @heathyboyj"
# switch-note

Quickly search and switch between your Inkdrop note from anywhere. This is a revised, working, and updated copy of [inkdrop-switch-note](https://github.com/heathyboyj/inkdrop-switch-note) plugin written by healthyboyj. This repo was made to make it easier for me to maintain a working copy this plugin since original plugin is not working anymore and have not been maintained since Jul 22, 2022. So credits to original author for the idea and original work.

### Installation

```
ipm install easy-note-switch
```

### Switching Between Notes

Activate the search dialog with either `cmd+k` or `ctrl+k`. The search functionality supports:
 - Case-insensitive searching of both the names of your notes and your notebooks.
 - Multiple, partial, and non-sequential parameters, separated by a space (see screenshot below for an example.)
 - Arrow keys + enter key for moving through the search results and opening the desired note.
